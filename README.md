# JayNVim

It's just my nvim configuration

## Structure

lua         lua files directory
|
|-config        nvim configuration
| |-plugins         plugins configuration
|-plugins       plugins downloads and startup settings
init.lua    init.lua

## OBS
- Needs to set envirioment variable 'NVIM\_CONFIG' to use config button of dashboard(im too lazzy to use stdpath)
- Remember to add nvim-data\mason\bin to $PATH

    it's my configuration, i don't made thinking in use of other machines, if something breaks it's your problem
